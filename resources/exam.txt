Understand Kubernetes API primitives
Exameple Question:
* Team Banana is taking over a webserver from Team Pineapple.
  No one from Pineapple is around anymore, so who knows where this webserver is.
  The only thing you know is that the container is named banana-boat
* Search for the correct pod in namespace pineapple and move it to namespace banana.

*************
This involves knowing how to work with basic Kubernetes objects like containers,
pods, services, deployment, and NAMESPACES.
*************  

Create and configure basic Pods
Example Question:
* Create a single pod in namespace default with the image nginx:1.7.9.
  The pod should be named alphapod and the container should be named 
  alphapod-container

* 3%
*************
Can you build a Pod manifest from a set of parameters, such as pod name,
container name, container image, and so forth?
*************

Understand Multi-Container Pod design patterns
Example Question:
* Missing data has long been a thorn in your company's side.
  A Tech Lead has whipped up a container named snooper-con
  in deployment snooper in namespace starfruit.
  This container mounts a volume and writes logs into a file called snooper.log.
  The YAML for the existing deployment is available at snooper.yaml

* Inside this deployment, create a sidecar container named kenneylogger-con,
  image busybox:1.13.0. Save your changes as snooper-new.yaml but also 
  make sure the deployment is running.
* 6%

*************
These kinds of questions will require you to create pods with sidecar containers,
such as ambassador, adapter, and reverse proxy sidecars.
*************

Understand Deployment and hot perform rolling updates
Example Question:

* In namespace coconut there is single pod named watermelon.
  Convert the pod into a deployment with 5 replicas and deployment 
  name watermelonsile.
* Create the deployment and save its YAML under watermelonslie.

* 8%
*************
You should know how to build a deployment from a set of given parameters like replica,
count, pod name, servicesaccount assignment, etc. You may even be asked to adapt a Pod manifest
into a deployment manifest.
*************
Understand Deployment and hot to perform rolling rollback
Example Question:
* There is an existing deployment named lemon in namespace banana.
  Apparently teh current version is broken, Check the deployment history and rollback
  to a version that actually workds.
* 4%
*************
Understand Deployment and how to perform rolling rollbacks. You could be 
given an existing deployment that is already serveral revisions old.
Be prepared to rollback using kubeclt undo to a previous version.
*************

Understand Jobs and Cron Jobs
Example Question:
* Team Banana needs a job template located at bananajob.yaml.
  This job should execute the commands sleep 2 && echo done on image busybox:1.31.0
  in namespace banana. Make it execute 3 pods in parallel for 5 total completions
* Every pod generated by banannajob should have the label eatyour:bananas. 
  The job should be named bananajob and the container named banana-bin.

Understand how to use Labels, Selectors and Annotations
Example Question:
* Team Melon needs to identify some of their pods in namespace basket.
  They ask you to add a new label safe:sound to all pods with an existing label
  type: citrus or type: seedless. All pods with the label safe:sound will then be given 
  the annotation fruit: good for what ails ya
* 3%

*****
Labels and annotations may be asked to be arbitrarily added to a pod or Deployment.
You may also need to change labels of objects to include them in something like a ReplicaSet
or NetworkPolicy
